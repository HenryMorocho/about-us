__Month 2__

* Helped make substantive improvements by contributing to multiple epics and across milestones.
* Deeper understanding on how the overall architecture works and how the services work together
* Review with your manager on your progress (you should've been getting continuous feedback :)).

We want to improve this process as we hire more people, so if you see anything that needs changing, just do it :).
