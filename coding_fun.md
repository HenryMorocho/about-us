## Tech/Coding Fun

Most of these should be doable in 2-4 hours of time.  If the person is remote, I think we can try to give tasks that could span 1-2 days.

### What are we testing?

* Technical Acumen, can you actually code :)
* Given a consistent environment, how do you perform vs others?
* But even more importantly did you do it with the right [Core Behaviors](https://github.com/packethost/about-us#done-right-through-core-behaviors)
  * Care - Did you care to do a good job?  Did the code base pass the "sniff" test?
  * Small Steps - is your code built in an iterative way?
  * Listen, Collab - did you read the challenge carefully and ask questions when things were unclear?
  * Honest Feedback - did you provide insightful feedback to us?
  * Seek learning - Did you explore and try different techniques for your code?  Were you able to read the instructions and fill in the gaps independently?

### Challenges

* [Build something with our API](tech_1.md)

### Work in Progress

Below are tests we've thought about but haven't worked out all the specific details yet

#### Break the monolith

Level : Senior   
Time : 8-16 hours   
Type : Backend   

[Details](tech_2.md))

#### Improve our API / Refactoring

Level : Senior    
Time : 4 - 8 hours   
Type : Backend   

* Login to our [NewRelic account](https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/45249/applications/9068939)
  * Provide 3 areas of suggestions for the code base
  * Out of the 3, pick one area which you'd like to explore
* Review "redacted" version of our API code base
* Issue PR for refactor of the "trouble" area

#### Improve our SDKs

Level : Any   
Time : 2-4 hours   
Type : Backend   

* Pick a language (that we have a SDK for)
* Review the SDK and then make changes to it and issue a PR
* The interviewer will do a code review with the person and walk through the changes

#### Be a customer

Level : Any   
Time : 2-4 hours   
Type : Backend   

* Provider person with a dev account.
* Use our API / SDKs / Getting started guide to launch a small farm of machines to run a frontend/backend "hello world" app.
  * The front end should display a message
  * The backend API should provide the response that the front-end should display, start with "Hello World"

#### Improve our UI

Level : Any   
Time : 2-4 hours   
Type : Frontend   

* Login to Rollbar and review our staff portal [exceptions](https://rollbar.com/Packet/Staff-Portal/)
* Pick one of the exceptions to [debug](https://rollbar.com/Packet/Staff-Portal/items/2414/)
* Provide access to our Staff Portal code base
* Debug on what you think the problem is

#### Helpful tools

Level : Any   
Time : 4-8 hours   
Type : Any.
