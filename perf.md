### (WIP) Evaluating Performance
_Note, this still requires feedback and has not been fully adopted_

As part of our core behavior, we should be providing feedback to each other constantly but there also needs to be a more formal way to evaluate our progress.  This is something your team lead or manager should be doing with you on at least a monthly basis.

We rate on 3 major criteria

Core Behaviors
Skills / Ability
Team Behvaiors

The scoring goes from 1 - 5, 5 being the best.  There will be a self eval along with your lead's eval.

An example of this rating sheet is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_afhy28k9tRCrYrAc9ahL46ADWWP4MGKtr8HeeMuKLM/edit#gid=0)
