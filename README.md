### Our Team Culture

<img src=rsrc/learning.jpg>

Teammates driven by [Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive:_The_Surprising_Truth_About_What_Motivates_Us) working together with [psychological safety](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html) is the basis for everything we do.

### Done right through Core Behaviors

Read more about our details [here](behavior_details.md).

* __Care about...__ - This is the most important behavior as all other behaviors depend on this
* __Take small purposeful steps__ - We are doing some great things, but we can only get there one commit at a time.
* __Listen then collaborate__ - Listen to understand, rather than to respond
* __Provide Continuous Feedback & Progress__ - effective communications is really hard, but essential to our work
* __Seek learning and be uncomfortable__ - Don't get complacent, find new ways to do things

If you retain anything from this article, it is the core behaviors from above.  We live by this, we [hire](interview.md) based on this and evaluate [performance](perf.md) based on this.  If you excel at those, you will go far in Packet SWE.

### Our Team

We've adapted the "Spotify" [model](https://blog.crisp.se/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/SpotifyScaling.pdf) for scaling our teams.  We have a few squads and are still experimenting with the right mix of people and skillsets.

A Squad is the smallest group of people, which is usually no bigger than 8 members. They are responsible for one key area. The Squad members have end-to-end responsibility. The freedom of their choices and decisions is limited by the companyâ€™s mission and by the product strategy. The Product Owner decides on the hierarchy of priorities for Squad members. They are responsible for small and frequent releases.
Each Squad has professionals which specialize in certain areas. All these people, who have the same responsibilities in separate Squads, are gathered in a group called a Chapter. An Engineering Manager is a line manager here. Everyone is a member of both a Squad and Chapter.
