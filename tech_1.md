## Build something with our API

Effort Level : 2-4 hours

Your goal is to build an integration with our API.  Please review the instructions

* Pick a language
* Create a public GitHub repo and utilize any tooling you desire
* Review our [API docs](https://www.packet.com/developers/api/)
  * Understand [auth](https://www.packet.com/developers/api/#authentication)
  * Know the available [OSes](https://www.packet.com/developers/api/#operatingsystems)
  * [Devices](https://www.packet.com/developers/api/#devices) is the main api you'll need
* Receive an API token for our system
  * This will be under our ["Interview"](https://app.packet.net/projects/ca73364c-6023-4935-9137-2132e73c20b4) project
  * This will be shared and you won't have direct access to that page
  * [Tokens](https://app.packet.net/projects/ca73364c-6023-4935-9137-2132e73c20b4/settings/api-keys) will be created on a per interviewee basis
* Build an interface to our SDK, which allows you to launch a machine and tear it down
  * If its a frontend language, build an UI
  * If its a backend language, build a CLI
* Provide Feedback on what you liked about this exercise as well as improvements you would make, this could be anything (from our docs to the api itself)
* Extra Credit
  * Pick any additional capabilities in our API that you'd think would be useful to add to the interface
* Upon completion, please send a link to the GitHub repo with a rough estimate on how long you took
  * If you're doing this in person, we'll walkthrough the code and feedback together
  * If you're remote, then we'll schedule a follow-up call to review it or do it in your next round of interviews

This is all on the honor system but we didn't need to tell you that ;)
