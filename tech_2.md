## Tech Challenge 2

* Review our API
* Propose a logical separation of the various apis to sub-groups
* Pick any method you can think of to simulate a master "controller" that can call into the grouped sub-sets of APIs.

### What we're testing?

* Can you come up with logical separations of an API?
* Could you research and come up with ideas to separate the APIs?
