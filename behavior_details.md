### Take small purposeful steps

We are doing some great things, but we can only get there one commit at a time.

  * Understand "what" the problem statement is and how it impacts the user or customer
  * Think "[how](https://blog.crisp.se/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/mvp.png)" can I do this in incremental steps, by providing useful functionality along the way.
  * Expect __failure__ along the way and feel the freedom to experiment to find the right solution
  * Practice makes perfect
