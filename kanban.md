## (WIP) WHy Kanban?

Increase business agility by giving predictability to flow of the development team while dealing with complex projects with challenging and non-deterministic timelines

[Quote](http://a.co/6VZSFpy) from the book

```"Our deadlines were set by managers without regard to engineering complexity, risk, or project size. Our code base had evolved from the original startup company, where many corners had been cut. One senior developer insisted on referring to our product as “a prototype.” We were in desperate need of greater productivity and higher quality in order to meet business demands."```


### Overview

Six Steps for Success

* Focus on Quality
* Reduce Work-in-Progress
* Deliver Often
* Balance Demand against Throughput
* Prioritize
* Attack Sources of Variability to Improve Predictability

The first 3 are what can be controlled by the team, while the others require buy in and more advanced skills

### Mapping our Value Stream

Figure out where all of requests come from

### Successful Standups

Standups should focus the tasks at hand, review from right to left, top to bottom.

* What should finish up today and any potential challenges you foresee
* What is blocked AND stale, why and how people can help get it moving again
* Any work in progress that’s not on the board (and a commitment to get it on the board today)

Remember that the goal of a standup is to make a plan for the day, not solve the day’s problems.
