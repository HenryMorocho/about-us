# (WIP) Leading at Packet
_this is a work in progress and something we're working to adopt_

There are two distinct and __equivalent__ leadership tracks within Software Engineering, one as an  individual contributor (IC) who actively works on the technical product and systems and one as a people leader, who helps recruit, hire and nuture people's careers.  These two tracks are equal in both pay and responsibility and is of equal importance.

Here are some examples of responsiblities

## Technical Leader

* Makes key technical and architectural decisions about a product or focus area
* Keep up to date on relevant technologies and techniques
* Helps mentor fellow engineers and help them grow technically
* Engages broader community via meetups, webinars, blogs and the like.

## People Leader

* Leads the hiring and career growth process
* Understands the unique skillsets of each team member and how they fit on the team
* Keeps up to date on the latest techniques in hiring, mentoring and growing people
* Promotes a diversity of thought and experience

## Common Traits

* Lives and breathes our Core Values and Behaviors
* Embraces autonomy, master and purpose for oneself and the team
* Helps promote psychological safety among team members

## Tiers

Here's a visual representation of the tiers.  See details below

Summary

Tier | Software  | Systems | People
---- |--------- | ------ | ----
1 | Software Engineer | Systems Engineer | Project Manager
2 | Senior Software Engineer | Senior Systems Engineer | Eng Manager
3 | Staff Engineer | Systems Architect | Director of Engineering
4 | Distinguished Engineer | Distinguished Engineer | VP of Engineering

Level 1: Performing well at level    
Level 2: Exhibiting qualities of next level   
Level 3: Consistently displaying qualities of next level   

### Software

These engineers focus on product development and delivering iterative customer value

Name  | Summary
--------- | ------
Software Engineer | Actively contributing production level code
Senior Software Engineer | Own direction/architecture for 1-3 services, technical mentor to engineers
Staff Engineer | Complex architectures across multiple services and product areas,<br> mentoring senior engs, help other teams with their architecture
Distinguished Engineer | Deep expertise in a couple of areas, has technical vision of entire<br> product, growing several staff/senior engs, help squads succeed, industry leading expert

### Systems

These engineers focus on our infrastructure and all the bits that makes our hardware resilient and our OS support state of the art

Name  | Summary
--------- | ------
Systems Engineer | Managing our infrastructure and OSes
Senior Systems Engineer | Own automation strategy for our OSes, Firmware, BMCs etc
Systems Architect | Design out complex architectures for a globally distrbuted infrastructure including<br> tooling and monitoring required to manage it
Distinguished Engineer | Deep expertise in hardawre or OSes, technical vision of global infrastructure,<br>mentoring senior systems engineers and architects, help multiple squads succeed, <br>industry leading expert


### People

These people focus on our talent, nuturing, growing, and making them self sufficient as well as providing technical and process guidance.

Name | Summary
--------- | ----
Project Manager | Helping a small group of engineers reach execution success
Eng Manager | Managing a team of people, who could be part of different squads
Director of Engineering | Leading several squads, mentors to other managers,<br> grew someone to Manager
VP of Engineering | Leading an entire tribe, mentors to other Directors and Managers,<br> grew several people to managers, grew someone to director level,<br> advisor to leaders outside of our company

Note: While it's not a strict requirement that our people leaders have engineering backgrounds, many of them do.
