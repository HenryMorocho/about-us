## Design something for our app

Effort Level : 2-4 hours

Your goal is to design a new or improved specific user experience.  Please review the instructions

* Pick one of the 3 options you have been presented with
* Create a prototype and utilize any tooling you desire
* Provide Feedback on what you liked about this exercise as well as improvements you would make, this could be anything 
* Extra Credit
  * Pick any additional area in our app that you would re-design and explain why and how you would approach
* Upon completion, please send the files (or link) with a rough estimate on how long you took
  * If you're doing this in person, we'll walkthrough the design process and feedback together
  * If you're remote, then we'll schedule a follow-up call to review it or do it in your next round of interviews

This is all on the honor system but we didn't need to tell you that ;)


### What are we testing?

* Design proficiency, can you actually design :)
* Given a consistent environment, how do you olve design problems vs others?
* But even more importantly did you do it with the right [Core Behaviors](https://github.com/packethost/about-us#done-right-through-core-behaviors)
  * Care - Did you care to do a good job?  Did the design approach pass the "sniff" test?
  * Small steps - Is your approach iterative?
  * Listen, Collab - Did you read the challenge carefully and ask questions when things were unclear?
  * Feedback - Did you provide insightful feedback to us?
  * Seek learning - Did you do research. Did you explore and try different approaches?  Were you able to read the instructions and fill in the gaps independently?
